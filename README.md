# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project implements machine learning models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the **Fraud Detection Dataset**.  
Due to the high class imbalance, **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** was applied to balance the dataset before training.

---

## üìå Dataset
- **Train set shape:** (6226, 23)  
- **Test set shape:** (4667, 23)  
- Target column: `is_fraud` (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraud)  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow
1. Import required libraries  
2. Load training and testing datasets  
3. Remove non-numerical columns  
4. Handle class imbalance using **SMOTE**  
5. Scale features with **StandardScaler**  
6. Train multiple models:  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree  
   - Random Forest  
7. Evaluate results with:  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Classification Report  
   - ROC-AUC Score

## üìä Observations
- Logistic Regression failed to classify legitimate transactions (all predicted as fraud).  
- Decision Tree and Random Forest classified legitimate transactions well but **completely failed on fraud detection** due to extreme class imbalance.  
- ROC-AUC scores are ~0.5, indicating **poor discrimination ability**.  

---

## üöÄ Future Improvements
- Use **ensemble methods** like XGBoost or LightGBM.  
- Apply **advanced resampling techniques** (e.g., SMOTEENN, ADASYN).  
- Engineer additional fraud-related features.  
- Try **deep learning models** for anomaly detection.
